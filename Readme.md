##Odd and Even
Write a program to find the sum of all the odd integers in the range 1 to 99.

(Hint: use a for-loop that starts at 1, ends at 99 and has an increment of 2)

##Sum and Average
Write a program to calculate the sum and average of 1, 2, 3, ...,N where N is an
integer input from the keyboard.

N must be a positive number. If the user enters an invalid number, continually prompt
the user for a valid number.

Example:

Input a positive number N: 0

Input a positive number N: -1

Input a positive number N: 6

The sum of the numbers from 1 to 6 is 21 and the average is 3.5

(Use a do-while loop to input the positive number and a for loop to find the sum of the numbers)
